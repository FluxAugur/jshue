## Introduction

jsHue is a simple JavaScript wrapper library for the Philips Hue API with a sane
object interface and without unnecessary dependencies. It is primarily intended
for use in modern web browsers supporting XHR and JSON, but with injection of
suitable dependencies it could also be used in other environments like Node.js.
